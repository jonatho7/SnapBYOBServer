        <h3>Enriching Online Educational Programming Platform Curricula:</h3>
        <p>One of the primary aims of this project is the enrich the curricula of online educational programming platforms. But why does the curricula of educational programming platforms need any modifications?</p>
        <p>Despite the popularity of online programming platforms, so far they have failed to realize their promise as a means of motivating and retaining a diverse population of students. Namely, current online students are often turned away by the curriculum's prevalent focus on entertainment, such as games and animation. Not developing the necessary motivation to study computer science, many students are dropping out having failed to see computing as a tool for solving real world problems in their lives [3]. Additionally, women and minorities remain woefully underrepresented in computing, with the typical over-emphasis on games and animation contributing to the underrepresentation [4].</p>
        <p>The widely recognized and well-validated <b>MUSIC model of academic motivation</b> [7] explains this lack of motivation [6]. It suggests that students become internally motivated when they perceive that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>they are eMpowered; </li>
                <li>the content is Useful; </li>
                <li>they can be Successful; </li>
                <li>they are Interested; and </li>
                <li>they feel Cared for by the instructor and other students.</li>
            </ol>
         <p>The MUSIC model shows that existing educational programming platforms fail to provide useful and interesting content to a diverse audience; not everyone is interested in games and animations, and it is hard to see this kind of development as generally useful [5]. A new, promising approach is to teach introductory computation in the context of big data science to solve real-world problems[1]. Unfortunately, these platforms lack support for accessing real-time and big data sources, which can provide a unique context for teaching real-world problem solving. Indeed, addressing this technological shortcoming has the potential to empower students to explore real-world problems that are truly important to them.</p>
