		<h1>Iteration</h1>
        <p>Iteration is a very valuable technique which can let a user repeat a specific set of commands in order to achieve their goal. Iteration can be used to repeat the same set of commands once, twice, hundreds, or even thousands of times so that the user does not have to keep entering in the same code over and over again. A few examples of using iteration are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Repeatedly adding together a student’s grades from a gradebook to receive the total and then dividing the total by the number of assignments to calculate the average grade.</li>
            <li>Repeatedly printing out the magnitude of each of the world’s earthquakes that have occurred in the past day or week. </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>Iteration</b> is defined as:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">“the act of repeating a process with the aim of approaching a desired goal, target or result.” [1]</p>
        <p>Furthermore,</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">“Each repetition of the process is also called an iteration, and the results of one iteration are used as the starting point for the next iteration.” [1]</p>

        <br>
        <p>In part 1 of this example, first a program without iteration will be shown. Then in part 2 and 3, we will take advantage of using iteration in order to repeat a command hundreds of times. Next, you will solve a few iteration problems on your own.</p>
